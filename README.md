#Fraud
Fraud is a global problem. On average, 5% of company revenue is lost to fraud.
  - Data science has played a fundamental role in combating and preventing fraud.

##Benford's Law
Statistical law that deals with the expected distribution of the digits of naturally generated numbers.
  - example: accounts payable
Benford's Law analyzes the most significant digit and, from that, generates the expected distribution:
    1 -> 30.1%
    2 -> 17.6%
    3 -> 12.5%
    4 -> 9.7%
    5 -> 7.9%
    6 -> 6.7%
    7 -> 5.8%
    8 -> 5.1%
    9 -> 4.6%

### Non-conformity
The expected proportion != the proportion found
  - it could mean: Fraud, data alteration, systemic errors
